# Modulo 1 :date:
Summary of the first module

This module focused on programming logic, where I learned basic concepts such as variables, loops, objects, array and string methods, etc. 
I ended up developing complex systems using only these concepts and seeking ways to improve them with concepts I hadn't seen before, like "regular expressions." 
By accessing the "module_1" folder, you can check some of the projects done in classes.
